What Does the Research Say About Breastfeeding in Rural Areas?

The new University of Missouri study, published in the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing, found that many nursing parents living in rural settings don't always benefit from resources that might help them breastfeed. The result is that they end up not breastfeeding for as long as suburban and urban-based parents.1

Karry Weston, PhD, RN, led the research team behind the study; she and her team determined that rural parents lack pragmatic knowledge about breastfeeding (in other words they don't have a realistic understanding of the hard work that goes into breastfeeding once their children are born), and have a poor understanding of a newborn’s nutritional needs. These issues are only exacerbated by the fact that parents in rural areas are more likely to have limited or no support in continuing to breastfeed. 

As a result, parents living in rural areas were more likely to stop breastfeeding and turn to formula feeding in the first days or weeks of their child’s life. 

A Lack of Resources and Support Leads to Lower Rates of Breastfeeding Success
To create the study, Dr. Weston and her team looked at first-time moms living in rural areas, and with low socio-economic status. They learned that in addition to feeling unsure about the basics of breastfeeding, such as proper latching technique and whether the baby was getting enough breast milk, parents felt that the pressure to return to work soon after giving birth was also a major hurdle toward realizing long term breastfeeding success.1

Another surprising challenge that parents who want to breastfeed run up against in rural communities has to do with social and cultural norms in these areas. According to Dr. Weston, many rural families and communities—especially among older generations—frown upon breastfeeding. 

“This can add an extra layer of pressure onto a mother working to establish successful breastfeeding,” she tells Parents. “We all need to be more supportive of new mothers—no matter how they choose to feed their infants,” Dr. Weston urges.


How Rural Parents Can Achieve Their Breastfeeding Goals

Parents who live in rural areas shouldn't feel forced to give up breastfeeding if they don't want to. More support from family and friends is obviously one important key that will help them breastfeed for a longer stretch.

Education from day one is also essential in reversing the trend of rural parents giving up on breastfeeding early on—and that could like more information given out at hospitals, or more affordable access to lactation consultants. 

“I think we need to make sure that rural mothers are equipped with breastfeeding information and resources before being discharged from the hospital,” Dr. Weston tells Parents. 

From being comfortable with latching their newborn, to learning how to use a breast pump or self-express their breast milk, there are a lot of practical tips rural parents should be taking home with them that they simply are not, according to Dr. Weston.

“Another major finding from my study was that women were not aware that the normal amount of breast milk produced in the first week is only 1 to 2 ounces,” she adds. “They would give up if they only pumped that amount because they thought their infant was not getting adequate nutrition.” 

Dr. Weston explained that none of the women knew that counting wet diapers was an easy way to determine if your baby is getting enough breast milk early on.

In addition to gaining practical knowledge at the hospital, Dr. Weston says all families should have information about breastfeeding resources available to them, both in-person and online-doctors, pediatricians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals can guide breastfeeding parents toward literature that can keep them informed and up-to-date with the latest breastfeeding education, for instance.

What Is Being Done to Support Rural Parents on a Larger Scale
Clearly inroads must be made to support rural families at the grassroots level. Meanwhile, Anjana Solaiman, DNP, NNP-BC, IBCLC, C-EFM, assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, says larger-scale programs can help combat the problem as well.

The reality is that rural areas are slower to receive outreach and updated information, and therefore slower to experience change when it comes to stigmas around breastfeeding.2

“Educational initiatives targeting both healthcare providers and the community are crucial for promoting breastfeeding in rural areas,” Solaiman tells Parents. “Training healthcare providers to offer consistent and supportive breastfeeding advice can bridge the knowledge gap, while community education campaigns can shift cultural perceptions and normalize breastfeeding.”

Compounding the problem is that designated lactation consultants may not be available at many small hospitals in rural communities, according to Willow spokesperson (a company that makes a hands-free pump), Dr. Laurie Jones. Jones is a pediatrician and clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Arizona School of Medicine, and the founder of Dr. MILK (Mothers Interested in Lactation Knowledge), a breastfeeding support network.

“The cost of having International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLC) may be too high,” Dr. Jones explains, which is why they are fewer of these professionals working in rural areas.

Nicole Peluso, IBCLC and Manager of Lactation Services and Perinatal Education at Aeroflow Breastpumps, would add that lack of insurance coverage is another huge hurdle rural parents face. 

“In most states, Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield policies generally do not cover lactation support by a lactation consultant,” she explains—a policy may cover support via a doctor or midwife, but while these professionals specialize in some postpartum care they are not always experts in breastfeeding.  

Even when a parent has coverage, a lactation consultant may not be within a reasonable driving distance. That’s where the increasing use of telehealth services comes in handy. Still, as Peluso notes, “Many moms do not know about it.” Getting more parents informed about telehealth services is key in those circumstances—many more services might be available remotely than parents realize.

Finally, Medha Nicky Rishi, Founder of MissPoppins, an online parenting support resource, points to non-flexible work schedules among lower-income individuals as a reason for breastfeeding rates dropping off. 


Current Resources for Breastfeeding Parents in Rural Areas

The good news is that there are some resources that are currency available for anyone who wants breastfeeding help. 

Sascha Mayer, Cofounder, Chief Experience Officer at Mamava, wants parents to know that the USDA WIC office offers lactation support through peer counselors and certified lactation consultants (CLCs).

“You can contact your local WIC clinic to make an appointment or the Office on Women's Health also offers a helpline at (800) 994-9662 with trained breastfeeding counselors who will answer the phone,” she advises.

Peluso advises anyone currently looking for help to consider telehealth options, which may be especially beneficial for parents who are experiencing challenges around breastfeeding upon returning to work, but have other caregiving duties, don't drive or don't have gas money, or any other reason that might make it easier to receive help at home.

Lactation specialist with Miss Poppins Valentina Guzman agrees, saying, “In small towns, lactation consultants are simply harder to find, but the internet is filled with valuable information—from blogs and research articles to instructional videos.”


How To Advocate For Change

Overall, important steps toward positive change are being made, even if resources in these rural areas still have a long way to go.  

“We’re seeing progress with the PUMP Act and other legislation to protect and support breastfeeding moms in the workplace,” says Dr. Jones.

But breastfeeding parents who live in rural parts of the country will still face many challenges if they want to nurse their babies. Peluso encourages patients and providers to band together and lobby for insurance coverage for lactation support. And Guzman urges parents to advocate for better workplace lactation policies to support breastfeeding efforts.

      title: '''The Benefits and Challenges of Breastfeeding: A Comprehensive Guide''',
      imageUrl: 'assets/images/BF2.jpg',
      description: '''
      Breastfeeding has been a cornerstone of infant care for centuries, recognized for its numerous health benefits for both the baby and the mother. While it is widely recommended by health organizations around the world, many mothers face challenges, both practical and societal, when it comes to breastfeeding. This article explores the multiple benefits of breastfeeding, the common challenges mothers face, and the societal perspectives on extended breastfeeding.

1. Health Benefits of Breastfeeding for Baby and Mother
For the Baby:
Breast milk is often referred to as "liquid gold" because of its rich nutritional content and numerous health benefits. The primary advantages of breastfeeding for infants include:

Complete Nutrition: Breast milk provides all the essential nutrients a newborn needs during the first six months of life, including vitamins, fats, and protein.
Immunity Boost: Colostrum, the first milk produced after childbirth, is packed with antibodies that help protect newborns from infections and illnesses.
Healthy Development: Studies have shown that breastfed babies are less likely to develop chronic conditions such as asthma, allergies, and obesity later in life.
Bonding: Breastfeeding promotes a strong emotional bond between the mother and the child, as physical closeness releases oxytocin, a hormone that fosters attachment.
For the Mother:
While breastfeeding is crucial for the baby's health, it also provides substantial benefits for mothers:

Postpartum Recovery: Breastfeeding helps the uterus return to its pre-pregnancy size more quickly, reducing the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.
Reduced Cancer Risks: Research indicates that breastfeeding lowers a woman's risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
Emotional Health: The act of breastfeeding helps reduce stress and anxiety, promoting emotional well-being by releasing oxytocin.
Weight Loss: While not a primary reason, breastfeeding helps mothers burn extra calories, aiding in post-pregnancy weight loss.
2. Common Challenges of Breastfeeding
Despite its benefits, breastfeeding can be challenging for many mothers. Some of the common issues faced include:

Latching Problems:
Getting the baby to latch properly is one of the first hurdles mothers often face. An improper latch can lead to nipple pain and inefficient milk transfer, which can discourage continued breastfeeding.

Low Milk Supply:
Many mothers worry about having a low milk supply, which can cause stress and anxiety. While some issues like stress and insufficient hydration can affect milk production, most women can produce enough milk with proper support and technique.

Sore Nipples:
Sore, cracked, or bleeding nipples are common, especially in the early days of breastfeeding. This issue is often caused by improper latching or positioning and can be addressed with lactation consultant support.

Workplace and Social Pressure:
Returning to work or facing public judgment can be significant barriers to breastfeeding. In many cases, mothers feel uncomfortable breastfeeding in public due to societal stigma, or they may struggle to continue breastfeeding while juggling a demanding job.

      description: '''
Many new mothers face challenges in the early days of breastfeeding, but these issues can often be overcome with the right knowledge and support. The most common issue new mothers encounter is nipple pain, usually caused by an improper latch. A poor latch can also affect the baby’s ability to feed effectively, leading to frustrations for both mother and child. It’s essential to ensure that the baby’s mouth covers not just the nipple but a large portion of the areola to reduce discomfort.

Another common challenge is the concern about milk supply. Some mothers worry they are not producing enough milk, but in most cases, milk production adjusts to the baby’s needs. Ensuring frequent feedings, staying hydrated, and practicing proper breastfeeding techniques can help. If there are concerns, mothers should seek guidance from lactation consultants who can offer personalized tips for improving milk supply and ensuring a smooth breastfeeding experience.

In addition, the social pressures surrounding breastfeeding can cause anxiety. Some mothers may feel embarrassed to nurse in public or face criticism for breastfeeding beyond the infant stage. Support from family, friends, and communities can alleviate these pressures and help mothers feel confident about their breastfeeding choices.

Breastfeeding in public is a topic that often sparks controversy, yet it is a natural act that should be normalized. Unfortunately, many mothers feel uncomfortable breastfeeding in public due to societal stigma. This stigma is often fueled by misconceptions that breastfeeding is inappropriate or indecent. However, breastfeeding is not only beneficial for the baby but also serves as a basic human right for mothers.

In many countries, laws have been put in place to protect mothers who choose to breastfeed in public. These laws make it illegal to discriminate against a mother for breastfeeding in public spaces, including parks, malls, and restaurants. The article advocates for a cultural shift towards accepting breastfeeding as a normal part of life, and the importance of public education and awareness campaigns to reduce stigma.

Real stories from mothers who have advocated for their right to breastfeed in public can serve as inspiration. They highlight the positive changes in public perception and the support they received from fellow parents and bystanders. The goal is to encourage a more accepting, supportive environment for mothers and families.

      description: '''
Breastfeeding beyond infancy, or extended breastfeeding, provides numerous psychological benefits for both the child and the mother. Psychologically, extended breastfeeding helps foster a secure attachment between mother and child. This attachment is key to the child’s emotional development, as it builds a sense of trust and security. A child who feels emotionally secure is more likely to develop positive social behaviors and coping mechanisms.

Additionally, extended breastfeeding has been shown to reduce anxiety and stress in children. For toddlers facing separation anxiety, breastfeeding provides comfort and reassurance, helping them navigate emotionally challenging situations. This emotional support continues to offer a calming effect during stressful transitions, such as starting preschool or dealing with a family change.

For mothers, extended breastfeeding can also be emotionally fulfilling. It allows them to continue providing care and nourishment for their child, which helps strengthen the maternal bond. Psychologists note that mothers who continue breastfeeding often feel more connected to their children and more attuned to their emotional needs.

      title: 'Breastfeeding and Its Role in Preventing Postpartum Depression',

      description: '''
Postpartum depression (PPD) affects many new mothers, but breastfeeding may offer a natural protective mechanism. Research suggests that breastfeeding helps regulate the hormones involved in emotional regulation, including oxytocin, a hormone released during breastfeeding that promotes feelings of well-being and calm. Oxytocin helps mothers feel more relaxed, reduce stress, and foster emotional bonding with their babies, all of which play a significant role in preventing PPD.

In addition to hormonal benefits, breastfeeding offers a sense of accomplishment and connection, helping to combat the feelings of isolation and frustration that many mothers experience in the postpartum period. Support from healthcare professionals, along with social support from family and friends, can also significantly impact a mother’s mental health during this time.

Several studies have shown that women who breastfeed are less likely to experience PPD compared to those who do not. However, if a mother does struggle with PPD despite breastfeeding, seeking professional mental health support is crucial. Breastfeeding should not be viewed as the sole solution, but as part of a broader strategy for postpartum care.

      imageUrl: 'assets/images/BF7.jpg',
      description: '''
While the primary focus of breastfeeding is typically on its benefits for infants, it also has long-term health advantages for mothers. One of the most significant health benefits is the reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Studies have shown that women who breastfeed for longer durations have a lower risk of developing these cancers. The longer the duration of breastfeeding, the greater the protection offered.

Breastfeeding also supports maternal health by helping mothers recover more quickly from childbirth. The act of breastfeeding stimulates uterine contractions, which help the uterus return to its pre-pregnancy size more quickly. Additionally, breastfeeding promotes weight loss by burning extra calories, making it easier for mothers to shed the pounds gained during pregnancy.

Psychologically, breastfeeding offers emotional benefits as well. The act of breastfeeding fosters a sense of accomplishment and well-being, promoting mental health through the release of feel-good hormones like oxytocin. In the long term, mothers who breastfeed often report feeling more bonded with their children, which strengthens the emotional connection and enhances family dynamics.
