" **Laid-back Breastfeeding** 
 laid- back breastfeeding, or Biological Nurturing, means getting
comfortable with your baby and encouraging your own and your baby’s
natural breastfeeding instincts. See biologicalnurturing.com for further
information.
 • Dress yourself and your baby as you choose.
 • Find a bed or couch where you can lean back and be well supported— not
fl at, but comfortably leaning back so that when you put your baby on
your chest, gravity will keep him in position with his body molded to
yours.
 • Have your head and shoulders well supported. Let your baby’s whole
front touch your whole front.
 • Since you’re leaning back, you don’t have a lap, so your baby can rest on
you in any position you like. Just make sure her whole front is against
you.
 • Let your baby’s cheek rest somewhere near your bare breast.
 • Help her as much as you like; help her do what she’s trying to do. You’re
a team.
 • Hold your breast or not, as you like.
 • Relax and enjoy each other.

**Waking a Sleepy Newborn**
If your newborn sleeps longer than three hours at a stretch, but
 • You had no birth medications
 • Your baby stays in physical contact with you
 • He feeds well when he feeds
 • His diapers are on track (see the Early Days Diaper Log)
that’s probably just who he is. Keep an eye on his poopy diapers and his
weight.
If he’s not gaining well and he sleeps more than three hours at a stretch,
aim for at least ten nursings each day until he wakes on his own and has at
least four good poopy diapers each day.
It will be easier to wake him to feed if you see some of the feeding cues
listed on the next tear sheet. If he’s sleeping and you try to lift his arm and
it drops like a rock when you let it go, he’ll be hard to wake. Try again in
twenty minutes. Things to try:
 • Dim the lights, pull the drapes. It’s easier if he doesn’t have to squint.
 • Undress him partially or completely. Put him on your chest.
 • Stroke him and call his name. Rub his feet.
 • Lay him down and roll him gently from all the way on one side to all
the way on his other side.
 • Hold him along your forearms, head in your hands, feet at your
elbows, and lift him from nearly horizontal to nearly vertical and
back, as you talk to him.
 • Wipe his face with a damp cloth.
 • Put a little colostrum or milk in his mouth— just a bit, waiting for
him to swallow before adding more.
He might latch and nurse in his sleep in a laid- back breastfeeding position, or
he might take sips from a spoon. Feed him in whatever way works for you.

**Feeding Cues**
 • A baby starts with subtle nursing cues— eyes moving beneath eyelids, eyelids fl uttering before they even open, hands coming toward
face, mouth movements.
 • Then she adds more obvious ones— rooting toward your chest,
whimpering or squeaking.
 • If you offer to nurse now, she’ll probably take your breast gently and
easily.
 • As her hunger builds, her body and mouth tense. She breathes fast or
starts to cry.
 • Once she’s crying, she’ll have a harder time latching. Crying is a late
sign of hunger. Calm her down before trying to feed her.
 • Breastfeeding is easier if you answer her requests instead of waiting
for her demands.
 • Don’t wait for your breasts to feel full. A full breast has already started
to slow down production.
 • Offer even if she’s not asking, anytime you like."

"Simple, smart, and effective solutions to your child’s struggles.”—Harvey Karp, M.D.

In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling Mindsight, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson offer a revolutionary approach to child rearing with twelve key strategies that foster healthy brain development, leading to calmer, happier children. The authors explain—and make accessible—the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures. The “upstairs brain,” which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids throw tantrums, fight, or sulk in silence. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child’s brain and foster vital growth.

Complete with age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles and illustrations that will help you explain these concepts to your child, The Whole-Brain Child shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.

“[A] useful child-rearing resource for the entire family . . . The authors include a fair amount of brain science, but they present it for both adult and child audiences.”—Kirkus Reviews

“Strategies for getting a youngster to chill out [with] compassion.”—The Washington Post

“This erudite, tender, and funny book is filled with fresh ideas based on the latest neuroscience research. I urge all parents who want kind, happy, and emotionally healthy kids to read The Whole-Brain Child. This is my new baby gift.”—Mary Pipher, Ph.D., author of Reviving Ophelia and The Shelter of Each Other

“Gives parents and teachers ideas to get all parts of a healthy child’s brain working together.”—Parent to Parent''',
